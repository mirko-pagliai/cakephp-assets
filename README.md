*cakephp-assets* is a CakePHP plugin to allows you to handle and generate assets.

It uses [matthiasmullie/minify](https://github.com/matthiasmullie/minify) and
provides a convenient helper that allows you to combine multiple asset files
into one single compressed file.

## Installation
You can install the plugin via composer:

    $ composer require --prefer-dist mirko-pagliai/cakephp-assets

**NOTE**: the package may require one of the latest versions version of CakePHP.  
Instead, the [cakephp3.2](//github.com/mirko-pagliai/cakephp-assets/tree/cakephp3.2) branch
is compatible with CakePHP versions from 3.2 onwards.  
In this case, you can install the package as well:

    $ composer require --prefer-dist mirko-pagliai/cakephp-assets:dev-cakephp3.2
    
After installation, you have to edit `APP/config/bootstrap.php` to load the plugin:

    Plugin::load('Assets', ['bootstrap' => true, 'routes' => true]);

For more information on how to load the plugin, please refer to the 
[Cookbook](http://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/plugins.html#loading-a-plugin).
    
By default the plugin uses the `APP/tmp/assets` directory to save the 
asset files. So you have to create the directory and make it writable:

    $ mkdir tmp/assets && chmod 775 tmp/assets

If you want to use a different directory, read below.

## Configuration
The plugin uses some configuration parameters and you can set them using the 
`\Cake\Core\Configure` class, **before** loading 
the plugin.

For example, you can do this at the bottom of the file `APP/config/app.php`
of your application.

### Configuration values

    Configure::write('Assets.force', false);

Setting `Assets.force` to `true`, the assets will be used even if debugging is 
enabled.

    Configure::write('Assets.target', TMP . 'assets');

Setting `Assets.target`, you can use another directory where the plugin will 
generate the assets.

## How to use
You have to use only the `AssetHelper`. This helper provides `css()` and
`script()` methods, similar to the methods provided by the `HtmlHelper`.

The syntax is the same, you just have to change the name helper. Example for
`AssetHelper::css()`.

    echo $this->Asset->css(['one.css', 'two.css']);

This will combine and compress `one.css` and `two.css` files, creating a unique
asset file, and will create a link element for CSS stylesheets, as does the 
method provided by the `HtmlHelper`.

The same also applies to the `AssetHelper::script()` method.

## Versioning
For transparency and insight into our release cycle and to maintain backward 
compatibility, *cakephp-assets* will be maintained under the 
[Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org).
